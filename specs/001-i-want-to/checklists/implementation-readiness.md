# Implementation Readiness Checklist: Retrieve Development Information from Jira Issue

**Purpose**: Pre-implementation validation of requirements quality - validates that specifications are complete, clear, and ready for development to begin

**Created**: 2025-10-07

**Focus**: Balanced coverage of API/technical requirements AND AI-first output requirements (happy path emphasis)

**Usage Context**: Author validates spec before coding begins

**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md) | [plan.md](../plan.md) | [data-model.md](../data-model.md)
