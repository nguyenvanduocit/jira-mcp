# Jira MCP

A Go-based MCP (Model Control Protocol) connector for Jira that enables AI assistants like Claude to interact with Atlassian Jira. This tool provides a seamless interface for AI models to perform common Jira operations.

## WHY

While Atlassian provides an official MCP connector, our implementation offers **superior flexibility and real-world problem-solving capabilities**. We've built this connector to address the daily challenges developers and project managers actually face, not just basic API operations.

**Key Advantages:**
- **More Comprehensive Tools**: We provide 20+ specialized tools covering every aspect of Jira workflow management
- **Real-World Focus**: Built to solve actual daily problems like sprint management, issue relationships, and workflow transitions
- **Enhanced Flexibility**: Support for complex operations like moving issues between sprints, creating child issues, and managing issue relationships
- **Better Integration**: Seamless integration with AI assistants for natural language Jira operations
- **Practical Design**: Tools designed for actual development workflows, not just basic CRUD operations

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need:
1. **Atlassian Account** with access to a Jira instance
2. **API Token** from Atlassian (we'll help you get this)
3. **Cursor IDE** with Claude integration

### Step 1: Get Your Atlassian API Token

1. Go to [Atlassian API Tokens](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens)
2. Click **"Create API token"**
3. Give it a name like "Jira MCP Connector"
4. **Copy the token** (you won't see it again!)

### Step 2: Choose Your Installation Method

We recommend **Docker** for the easiest setup:

#### üê≥ Option A: Docker (Recommended)

```bash
# Pull the latest image
docker pull ghcr.io/nguyenvanduocit/jira-mcp:latest

# Test it works (replace with your details)
docker run --rm \
  -e ATLASSIAN_HOST=https://your-company.atlassian.net \
  -e ATLASSIAN_EMAIL=your-email@company.com \
  -e ATLASSIAN_TOKEN=your-api-token \
  ghcr.io/nguyenvanduocit/jira-mcp:latest \
  --http_port 3000
```

#### üì¶ Option B: Download Binary

1. Go to [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/nguyenvanduocit/jira-mcp/releases)
2. Download for your platform:
   - **macOS**: `jira-mcp_darwin_amd64`
   - **Linux**: `jira-mcp_linux_amd64`  
   - **Windows**: `jira-mcp_windows_amd64.exe`
3. Make it executable (macOS/Linux):
   ```bash
   chmod +x jira-mcp_*
   sudo mv jira-mcp_* /usr/local/bin/jira-mcp
   ```

#### üõ†Ô∏è Option C: Build from Source

```bash
go install github.com/nguyenvanduocit/jira-mcp@latest
```

### Step 3: Configure Cursor

1. **Open Cursor**
2. **Go to Settings** ‚Üí **Features** ‚Üí **Model Context Protocol**
3. **Add a new MCP server** with this configuration:

#### For Docker Users:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "jira": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run", "--rm", "-i",
        "-e", "ATLASSIAN_HOST=https://your-company.atlassian.net",
        "-e", "ATLASSIAN_EMAIL=your-email@company.com", 
        "-e", "ATLASSIAN_TOKEN=your-api-token",
        "ghcr.io/nguyenvanduocit/jira-mcp:latest"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### For Binary Users:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "jira": {
      "command": "/usr/local/bin/jira-mcp",
      "env": {
        "ATLASSIAN_HOST": "https://your-company.atlassian.net",
        "ATLASSIAN_EMAIL": "your-email@company.com",
        "ATLASSIAN_TOKEN": "your-api-token"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Test Your Setup

1. **Restart Cursor** completely
2. **Open a new chat** with Claude
3. **Try these test commands**:

```
List my Jira projects
```

```
Show me issues assigned to me
```

```
What's in the current sprint?
```

If you see Jira data, **congratulations! üéâ** You're all set up.

## üîß Advanced Configuration

### Using Environment Files

Create a `.env` file for easier management:

```bash
# .env file
ATLASSIAN_HOST=https://your-company.atlassian.net
ATLASSIAN_EMAIL=your-email@company.com
ATLASSIAN_TOKEN=your-api-token
```

Then use it:
```bash
# With binary
jira-mcp -env .env

# With Docker
docker run --rm -i --env-file .env ghcr.io/nguyenvanduocit/jira-mcp:latest
```

### HTTP Mode for Development

For development and testing, you can run in HTTP mode:

```bash
# Start HTTP server on port 3000
jira-mcp -env .env -http_port 3000
```

Then configure Cursor with:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "jira": {
      "url": "http://localhost:3000/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

## üéØ Usage Examples

Once configured, you can ask Claude to help with Jira tasks using natural language:

### Issue Management
- *"Create a new bug ticket for the login issue"*
- *"Show me details for ticket PROJ-123"*
- *"Move ticket PROJ-456 to In Progress"*
- *"Add a comment to PROJ-789 saying the fix is ready"*

### Sprint Management  
- *"What's in our current sprint?"*
- *"Move these 3 tickets to the next sprint: PROJ-1, PROJ-2, PROJ-3"*
- *"Show me all tickets assigned to John in the current sprint"*

### Reporting & Analysis
- *"Show me all bugs created this week"*
- *"List all tickets that are blocked"*
- *"What tickets are ready for testing?"*

### Version Management
- *"List all versions for project PROJ"*
- *"Show me details for version 2.1.0"*
- *"What versions are unreleased in our project?"*

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**‚ùå "Connection failed" or "Authentication error"**
- Double-check your `ATLASSIAN_HOST` (should be like `company.atlassian.net`)
- Verify your API token is correct
- Make sure your email matches your Atlassian account

**‚ùå "No MCP servers found"**
- Restart Cursor completely after adding the configuration
- Check the MCP configuration syntax in Cursor settings
- Verify the binary path is correct (for binary installations)

**‚ùå "Permission denied" errors**
- Make sure your Atlassian account has access to the Jira projects
- Check if your API token has the necessary permissions

### Getting Help

1. **Check the logs**: Run with `-http_port` to see detailed error messages
2. **Test your credentials**: Try the Docker test command from Step 2
3. **Verify Cursor config**: The app will show you the exact configuration to use
